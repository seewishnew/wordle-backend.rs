# Wordle Backend API Server

This is the backend for the [wordle.rs](https://github.com/seewishnew/wordle.rs) frontend project. It handles user registration, game creation, and answer validation and stores all data in MongoDB. A MongoDB container can be spun up using `make deploy-mongo`.

This project uses the rocket framework and is entirely written in Rust.
